The purpose of this website is to conduct analysis on a public dataset. This site contains 3 parts

1) A public dataset was chosen. A link to this dataset as well as a short description of why I chose it can be found in the "About the Data" section.

2) Visualizations of the Statistics on the dataset, and some initial exploratory analysis is conducted in the "Exploratory Analysis" section.

3) A report summarizing the results of applying an optimized elastic net model on the data to predict outcomes can be found in the "Predictive Model" section.

I decided during my undergraduate studies at the University of Iowa, and through my time as a Precision Analyst at [VIDA Diagnostics](https://vidadiagnostics.com/) that precision medicine is a field that I need to be in as I continue my professional development. This interest sparked my desire to obtain an MS in Statistics so I could amplify my understanding of what goes in to analytics in healthcare and medicine.
